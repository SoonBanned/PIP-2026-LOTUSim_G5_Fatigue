Question,Answer
"According to Rule 32, what are the precise definitions of a ""whistle,"" a ""short blast,"" and a ""prolonged blast""?","A whistle is any sound signalling appliance capable of producing the prescribed blasts and which complies with the specifications in Annex III to these Regulations.

A short blast means a blast of about one second's duration.

A prolonged blast means a blast of from four to six seconds' duration."
"What are the minimum visibility ranges for the masthead light, sidelight, and sternlight on vessels of 50 meters or more in length?","6 miles for masthead light, 3 miles for sidelight and sternlight."
"Under Rule 10 regarding Traffic Separation Schemes, when is a vessel allowed to enter a separation zone or cross a separation line?",A vessel may normally enter a separation zone or cross a separation line except in cases of emergency to avoid immediate danger or to engage in fishing within a separation zone.
What precise sound signal must a vessel aground give if she is 100 meters or more in length?,"A vessel aground, and being 100 metres or more in length, shall give three separate and distinct strokes on the bell immediately before and after the rapid ringing of the bell."
"Summarize the actions a vessel must take to determine if a ""risk of collision"" exists, specifically regarding the use of equipment and observations.","A vessel must use all available means appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions to determine if risk of collision exists, including proper use of radar equipment, long-range scanning, and not making assumptions on the basis of scanty information."
"Describe the lighting configuration required for a vessel ""not under command"" (NUC) according to Rule 27, including when she is making way.","A vessel ""not under command"" (NUC) at anchor shall exhibit two all-round red lights in a vertical line where they can best be seen, and when making way through the water, she shall also exhibit sidelights and a sternlight."
"Explain the hierarchy of responsibilities between different vessel types (Power-driven, Sailing, Fishing, NUC, RAM, Constrained by draught) as outlined in Rule 18.","The hierarchy of responsibilities between different vessel types is as follows:

1. A power-driven vessel underway shall keep out of the way of:
	* Vessels not under command (NUC)
	* Vessels restricted in their ability to manoeuvre (RAM)
	* Vessels engaged in fishing
	* Sailing vessels
2. A sailing vessel underway shall keep out of the way of:
	* Vessels not under command (NUC)
	* Vessels restricted in their ability to manoeuvre (RAM)
	* Vessels engaged in fishing
3. A vessel engaged in fishing when underway shall, so far as possible, keep out of the way of:
	* Vessels not under command (NUC)
	* Vessels restricted in their ability to manoeuvre (RAM)"
"Based on the ""IMO Recommendation on Navigational Watchkeeping,"" what are the key factors the officer of the watch must consider when deciding if they can act as the sole look-out in daylight?","The state of weather, conditions of visibility, traffic density, proximity of navigational hazards."
"A sailing vessel is overtaking a power-driven vessel. According to the interaction between Rule 13 and Rule 18, which vessel is the ""stand-on"" vessel and why?","The power-driven vessel is the stand-on vessel because it is not required to keep out of the way according to Rule 18(a)(iv), but rather the sailing vessel must keep out of the way as per Rule 13."
"A vessel detects another vessel by radar alone in restricted visibility and determines a close-quarters situation is developing. If the target is forward of the beam (but not being overtaken), what specific manoeuvre must be avoided according to Rule 19?","An alteration of course to port for a vessel forward of the beam, other than for a vessel being overtaken."
"A vessel is ""restricted in her ability to manoeuvre"" and is engaged in a towing operation that restricts her ability to deviate from course. According to Rule 27(c) and Rule 24(a), precisely what combination of lights must be shown at night?","According to Rule 27(c) and Rule 24(a), the vessel must show: 

* Masthead light, sidelights, and sternlight (Rule 24(a))
* Three all-round lights in a vertical line where they can best be seen (the highest and lowest of which are red and the middle one is white)
* Three shapes in a vertical line where they can best be seen (the highest and lowest of which are balls and the middle one is a diamond)"
"In a ""crossing situation"" (Rule 15), if the stand-on vessel finds herself so close that collision cannot be avoided by the give-way vessel alone, what action is she required to take, and what specific restriction applies to her course alteration if the other vessel is on her port side?","The stand-on vessel shall take such action as will best aid to avoid collision and shall not alter course to port for a vessel on her own port side, but may alter course to starboard if the circumstances of the case admit (Rule 17(b) and (c))."
