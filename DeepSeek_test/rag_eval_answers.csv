"A sailing vessel is overtaking a power-driven vessel. According to the interaction between Rule 13 and Rule 18, which vessel is the ""stand-on"" vessel and why?",I don't know.
"A vessel detects another vessel by radar alone in restricted visibility and determines a close-quarters situation is developing. If the target is forward of the beam (but not being overtaken), what specific manoeuvre must be avoided according to Rule 19?","According to (Chunk 26 | RULE 19) , if a close- quarters situation is developing, the vessel shall take avoiding action in ample time, and when such action consists of an alteration of course, the following should be avoided: ""(i) an alteration of course to port for a vessel forward of the beam, other than for a vessel being overtaken."""
"A vessel is ""restricted in her ability to manoeuvre"" and is engaged in a towing operation that restricts her ability to deviate from course. According to Rule 27(c) and Rule 24(a), precisely what combination of lights must be shown at night?","According to Chunk 40 | Rule 27, specifically Rule 27(c), a vessel restricted in its ability to manoeuvre engaged in a towing operation that severely restricts the towing vessel and her tow from deviating from their course shall exhibit, in addition to the lights or shapes prescribed in Rule 24(a), three all-round lights in a vertical line where they can best be seen (the highest and lowest of these lights being red and the middle light white)."
"In a ""crossing situation"" (Rule 15), if the stand-on vessel finds herself so close that collision cannot be avoided by the give-way vessel alone, what action is she required to take, and what specific restriction applies to her course alteration if the other vessel is on her port side?","According to Rule 17 [Chunk 23], in a ""crossing situation"" (Rule 15), if the stand-on vessel finds herself so close that collision cannot be avoided by the give-way vessel alone, she shall take such action as will best aid to avoid collision. The specific restriction applies to her course alteration: if the other vessel is on her port side, she shall not alter course to port [Rule 17(c)]."
