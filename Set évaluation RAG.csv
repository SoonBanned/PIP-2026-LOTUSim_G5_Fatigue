1,Factual Retrieval,"According to Rule 32, what are the precise definitions of a ""whistle,"" a ""short blast,"" and a ""prolonged blast""?","A ""whistle"" is any sound signalling appliance capable of producing the prescribed blasts and complying with Annex III. A ""short blast"" is a blast of about one second's duration. A ""prolonged blast"" is a blast of from four to six seconds' duration.","Rule 32: ""(a) The word 'whistle' means... (b) The term 'short blast' means a blast of about one second's duration. (c) The term 'prolonged blast' means a blast of from four to six seconds's duration."" "
2,Factual Retrieval,"What are the minimum visibility ranges for the masthead light, sidelight, and sternlight on vessels of 50 meters or more in length?",For vessels of 50 meters or more: • Masthead light: 6 miles• Sidelight: 3 miles• Sternlight: 3 miles,"Rule 22(a): ""In vessels of 50 metres or more in length: - a masthead light, 6 miles; - a sidelight, 3 miles; - a sternlight, 3 miles..."" "
3,Factual Retrieval,"Under Rule 10 regarding Traffic Separation Schemes, when is a vessel allowed to enter a separation zone or cross a separation line?",A vessel shall not normally enter a separation zone or cross a separation line except in two specific cases:1. In cases of emergency to avoid immediate danger.2. To engage in fishing within a separation zone.,"Rule 10(e): ""...shall not normally enter a separation zone or cross a separation line except: (i) in cases of emergency to avoid immediate danger; (ii) to engage in fishing within a separation zone."" "
4,Factual Retrieval,What precise sound signal must a vessel aground give if she is 100 meters or more in length?,"She must ring the bell rapidly for about 5 seconds in the forepart of the vessel. Immediately after, the gong shall be sounded rapidly for about 5 seconds in the after part. Additionally, she must give three separate and distinct strokes on the bell immediately before and after the rapid ringing of the bell. She may also sound an appropriate whistle signal.","Rule 35(g), (h): ""(h) A vessel aground shall give the bell signal and if required the gone signal prescribed in paragraph (g)... and shall, in addition, give three separate and distinct strokes on the bell..."" "
5,Synthesis,"Summarize the actions a vessel must take to determine if a ""risk of collision"" exists, specifically regarding the use of equipment and observations.","A vessel must use all available means appropriate to the circumstances. If there is any doubt, risk is deemed to exist. This includes:1. Proper use of radar (long-range scanning and plotting).2. Not making assumptions on scanty information (especially radar).3. Observing compass bearing of approaching vessels; risk exists if the bearing does not appreciably change.4. Recognizing risk may exist even with bearing changes when approaching very large vessels, tows, or at close range.","Rule 7: ""(a) Every vessel shall use all available means... (b) Proper use shall be made of radar equipment... (c) Assumptions shall not be made on the basis of scanty information... (d)... risk shall be deemed to exist if the compass bearing... does not appreciably change..."" "
6,Synthesis,"Describe the lighting configuration required for a vessel ""not under command"" (NUC) according to Rule 27, including when she is making way.","A vessel not under command must exhibit:1. Two all-round red lights in a vertical line where best seen.2. Two balls or similar shapes in a vertical line (by day).3. When making way through the water, she must additionally exhibit sidelights and a sternlight.","Rule 27(a): ""A vessel not under command shall exhibit: (i) two all-round red lights... (ii) two balls... (iii) when making way through the water, in addition... sidelights and a sternlight."" "
7,Synthesis,"Explain the hierarchy of responsibilities between different vessel types (Power-driven, Sailing, Fishing, NUC, RAM, Constrained by draught) as outlined in Rule 18.","Power-driven vessels must keep out of the way of: NUC, RAM, Fishing, and Sailing vessels.Sailing vessels must keep out of the way of: NUC, RAM, and Fishing vessels.Fishing vessels (underway) must keep out of the way of: NUC and RAM vessels.All vessels (except NUC/RAM) should avoid impeding the safe passage of a vessel constrained by her draught (if circumstances admit).","Rule 18: ""(a) A power-driven vessel... shall keep out of the way of: (i) a vessel not under command; (ii) a vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre; (iii) a vessel engaged in fishing; (iv) a sailing vessel... (b) A sailing vessel... (c) A vessel engaged in fishing..."" "
8,Synthesis,"Based on the ""IMO Recommendation on Navigational Watchkeeping,"" what are the key factors the officer of the watch must consider when deciding if they can act as the sole look-out in daylight?",The officer can be the sole look-out only in daylight after a careful assessment establishes it is safe. Factors include:1. State of weather.2. Conditions of visibility.3. Traffic density.4. Proximity of navigational hazards.5. Navigation in or near a traffic separation scheme.Assistance must be immediately available if the situation changes.,"Section 1, Para 11(c): ""...sole look-out in daylight... followed after the situation has been carefully assessed... Full account shall be taken of... state of weather, conditions of visibility, traffic density, proximity of navigational hazards and if navigating in or near a traffic separation scheme."" "
9,Reasoning,"A sailing vessel is overtaking a power-driven vessel. According to the interaction between Rule 13 and Rule 18, which vessel is the ""stand-on"" vessel and why?","The power-driven vessel is the stand-on vessel and the sailing vessel is the give-way vessel. While Rule 18 usually requires power-driven vessels to keep clear of sailing vessels, Rule 13 (Overtaking) explicitly states ""Notwithstanding anything contained in the Rules of Part B, Sections I and II"" (which includes Rule 18), any vessel overtaking any other shall keep out of the way of the vessel being overtaken.","Rule 13(a): ""Notwithstanding anything contained in the Rules of Part B, Sections I and II any vessel overtaking any other shall keep out of the way of the vessel being overtaken."" "
10,Reasoning,"A vessel detects another vessel by radar alone in restricted visibility and determines a close-quarters situation is developing. If the target is forward of the beam (but not being overtaken), what specific manoeuvre must be avoided according to Rule 19?","The vessel must take avoiding action in ample time. If this action involves an alteration of course, the vessel must avoid altering course to port for a vessel forward of the beam (other than for a vessel being overtaken).","Rule 19(d)(i): ""...provided that when such action consists of an alteration of course, so far as possible the following shall be avoided: (i) an alteration of course to port for a vessel forward of the beam, other than for a vessel being overtaken;"" "
11,Reasoning,"A vessel is ""restricted in her ability to manoeuvre"" and is engaged in a towing operation that restricts her ability to deviate from course. According to Rule 27(c) and Rule 24(a), precisely what combination of lights must be shown at night?","The vessel must exhibit a complex combination of lights:1. From Rule 24(a): Two masthead lights in a vertical line (or three if the tow >200m).2. From Rule 24(a): Sidelights and a sternlight.3. From Rule 24(a): A towing light (yellow) above the sternlight.4. In addition (per Rule 27c), she must show the RAM lights: Three all-round lights in a vertical line (Red-White-Red).","Rule 27(c): ""A power-driven vessel engaged in a towing operation such as severely restricts... shall, in addition to the lights or shapes prescribed in Rule 24(a), exhibit the lights or shapes prescribed in sub-paragraphs (b)(i) and (ii) of this Rule."" (referencing Rule 24 and Rule 27(b)(i) )"
12,Reasoning,"In a ""crossing situation"" (Rule 15), if the stand-on vessel finds herself so close that collision cannot be avoided by the give-way vessel alone, what action is she required to take, and what specific restriction applies to her course alteration if the other vessel is on her port side?","The stand-on vessel shall take such action as will best aid to avoid collision (Rule 17(b)). However, if she alters course, she shall, if circumstances admit, not alter course to port for a vessel on her own port side (Rule 17(c)).","Rule 17(b) & (c): ""(b)...she shall take such action as will best aid to avoid collision. (c) A power-driven vessel which takes action... shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, not alter course to port for a vessel on her own port side."" "
